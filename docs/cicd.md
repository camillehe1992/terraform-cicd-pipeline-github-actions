# CICD Setup

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

The pipeline executes terraform scripts in container, which provide Terraform execution environment and providers pre-installed. The docker image is located in AWS ECR. You can use the official [image from Hashicorp](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/terraform/), but sometimes itâ€™s wise to maintain your own Docker images with additional tools you may need. If you decided to use the official image, skip `ecr_login.sh` and replace environment variable `TF_IMAGE` with `hashicorp/terraform`.
